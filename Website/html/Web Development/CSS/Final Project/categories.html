                <h3>Appetizers</h3>
                <p>Start your meal with delicious appetizers.</p>
                <p><b>1.</b>Preheat oven to 450°F.</p>
                <p><b>2.</b>Pierce potatoes several times with a fork and wrap in paper towels. Microwave on high for 13
                    to 15 minutes, until potatoes are cooked through. Remove from microwave and cool until potatoes are
                    easy to handle. Slice potatoes in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop all but 1/8 inch of the
                    inside of the potato, leaving skin intact. Reserve scooped potato flesh for another use.</p>
                <p><b>3.</b>Brush both inside and outside of potatoes with oil and sprinkle with salt. Place potatoes,
                    skin-side down, on a baking sheet and bake until skins are crisp and edges are golden brown, about
                    20 minutes.</p>
                <p><b>4.</b>In the meantime, prepare the filling. Steam the broccoli until crisp-tender, about 3 to 4
                    minutes. Drain and set aside. Spray a nonstick pan with cooking spray and preheat over medium-high
                    heat. Add the Canadian bacon and cook until crisp stirring often, about 3 to 4 minutes. Reserve.</p>
                <p><b>5.</b>To make avocado cream, combine scallion whites, avocado, sour cream lime juice, cilantro,
                    garlic and salt in the small bowl of a food processor and process on high until smooth. About 30
                    seconds.</p>
                <p><b>6.</b>Toss the broccoli with cheese and spoon filling evenly among potatoes. Lower oven to 400 °F
                    and return potatoes to oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the
                    avocado cream on top of broccoli-filled potatoes, then top with scallion greens and 1 teaspoon
                    crisped bacon bits.</p>

                <h3>Main Dishes</h3>
                <p>Explore our selection of main dishes that will satisfy your hunger.</p>
                <p><b>1.</b>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.</p>
                <p><b>2.</b>Cut the tofu in half horizontally and lay between layers of paper towels. Place on a plate,
                    top with another plate, and place a weight on top (a 14-ounce can of vegetables works well). Let
                    stand 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, cut the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and place in a large mixing
                    bowl. Add the carrots, cabbage, red pepper, scallions, ginger, cilantro, soy sauce, hoisin, sesame
                    oil, egg, salt, and pepper. Lightly stir to combine.</p>
                <p><b>3.</b>To form the dumplings, remove 1 wonton wrapper from the package, covering the others with a
                    damp cloth. Brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with water. Place 1/2 rounded teaspoon of the
                    tofu mixture in the center of the wrapper. Shape as desired. Set on a sheet pan and cover with a
                    damp cloth. Repeat procedure until all of the filling is gone.</p>
                <p><b>4.</b>Using a steaming apparatus of your choice, bring 1/4 to 1/2-inch of water to a simmer over
                    medium heat. Spray the steamer's surface lightly with the non-stick vegetable spray to prevent
                    sticking. Place as many dumplings as will fit into a steamer, without touching each other. Cover and
                    steam for 10 to 12 minutes over medium heat. Remove the dumplings from the steamer to a heatproof
                    platter and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat until all dumplings are cooked.</p>

                <h3>Desserts</h3>
                <p>Indulge your sweet tooth with our delightful desserts.</p>
                <p><b>1.</b>For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 12-cup muffin tins with paper
                    liners.</p>
                <p><b>2.</b>Whisk together the cake flour, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda
                    and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk together the buttermilk, coffee, oil, eggs and vanilla
                    in a separate bowl.</p>
                <p><b>3.</b>Pour half of the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and beat on low speed just until
                    combined. Scrape down the bowl then add the remaining wet ingredients and beat to combine. Scrape
                    down the bowl and paddle. Increase the speed to medium and beat for a full minute.</p>
                <p><b>4.</b>Fill the prepared cupcake tins 2/3 of the way full. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the
                    center of each comes out clean and the top springs back when lightly pressed, 15 to 18 minutes.</p>
                <p><b>5.</b>For the frosting: Melt the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl set over simmering water in
                    a medium saucepan. Remove from the simmering water and let it cool until room temperature, about 30
                    minutes.</p>
                <p><b>6.</b>Beat the butter and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until light
                    and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low, drizzle in the melted chocolate and beat until
                    completely blended. Gradually beat in the confectioners' sugar, cocoa powder and vanilla. Increase
                    the speed to high and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.</p>
                <p><b>7.</b>Transfer the frosting to a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. Decoratively pipe the
                    frosting onto the cupcakes.</p>
                <p><b>Cook's Note:</b></p>
                <p>When measuring flour, we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off excess. (Scooping directly
                    from the bag compacts the flour, resulting in dry baked goods). We like Dutch-process cocoa for our
                    chocolate cake because it adds a deep, mellow chocolate flavor, but regular cocoa powder will also
                    work. The flavor will just be slightly fruity and more acidic.</p>

                <p>Refresh yourself with our special coffee recipe.</p>
                <p><b>1.</b>Rim a tall heavy glass mug with sugar.</p>
                <p><b>2.</b>Drizzle in a little Galliano and swirl around the inside of the mug.</p>
                <p><b>3.</b>Add 1-ounce of Brandy and ¾-ounce Cointreau, followed by 4 to 5-ounces your rich roasted coffee brew.</p>
                <p><b>4.</b>Top with whipped cream and a splash of coffee liqueur.</p>
